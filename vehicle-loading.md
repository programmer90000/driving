# Vehicle Loading - Driving Theory Notes

## 1. Load Security
- **Secure all loads** properly to prevent movement during journey
- **Use appropriate restraints** - ropes, straps, or nets
- **Check load regularly** during long journeys
- **Loose items** can become dangerous projectiles in sudden stops

## 2. Weight Distribution
- **Heavy items** should be placed low down over the rear axle
- **The engine is heavy** and already weights the front - rear loading balances the vehicle
- **If very heavy**, distribute some weight between front and rear to maintain balance
- **Distribute weight evenly** side-to-side to maintain vehicle stability
- **Overloading the rear** makes steering light and unpredictable
- **Overloading one side** affects vehicle handling and increases roll risk

## 3. Legal Weight Limits
- **Don't exceed** maximum gross weight for your vehicle
- **Check manufacturer's plate** for weight limits
- **Overloading** is illegal and dangerous
- **Penalties** include fines and prohibition from driving

## 4. Roof Racks & Trailers
- **Roof loads** increase fuel consumption and affect stability
- **Secure roof loads** properly and check regularly
- **Trailer loads** must be properly secured and balanced
- **Maximum trailer width** is 2.55 metres

## 5. Hazardous Loads
- **Follow special rules** for dangerous goods
- **Display appropriate warning plates** if carrying hazardous materials
- **Know emergency procedures** for your specific load

## 6. Animal Transport
- **Animals must be suitably restrained** to prevent distraction
- **Use pet carriers, dog guards, or seat belt harnesses**
- **Never leave animals** in hot vehicles
- **Make regular stops** for water and exercise

## 7. Visibility & Lighting
- **Don't obscure lights, number plates, or windows**
- **Load must not stick out** dangerously
- **If load obscures lights**, fit additional lights
- **Keep windscreen and mirrors** clear at all times

## 8. Overhanging Loads
- **If load overhangs**, you must signal its presence
- **Use red flag** during day and red light at night for overhanging loads
- **Special rules apply** for very long or wide loads

## 9. Safety Checks
- **Check load security** before setting off and after breaks
- **Ensure doors and tailgates** are properly closed
- **Adjust headlights** if rear is heavily loaded
- **Check tyre pressures** for heavy loads

## 10. Environmental Impact
- **Cover loose loads** to prevent debris falling on road
- **Don't overload** - it increases fuel consumption and pollution
- **Dispose of waste** responsibly at licensed sites
