# Vulnerable Road Users - Driving Theory Notes

## 1. General Rules for All Vulnerable Users
- **Give plenty of space** when overtaking (at least 1.5 metres/5 feet)
- **Slow down** when approaching vulnerable users
- **Be patient** - don't intimidate them by driving too close or rushing them
- **Expect sudden movements** - they may swerve or change direction unexpectedly

## 2. Pedestrians
- **Children**: May run into road without looking - slow down near areas where there are children
- **Elderly**: May move slowly and have poor hearing/vision
- **Disabled**: People with mobility issues or guide dogs need extra time
- **Crossings**: MUST stop at Zebra crossings when someone is waiting/crossing
- **Pelican/Puffin crossings**: Stop on amber if safe to do so

## 3. Cyclists
- **Overtaking**: Leave at least 1.5 metres space, wait behind if unsafe
- **Junctions**: Check for cyclists before turning - they may be alongside you
- **Roundabouts**: Give cyclists plenty of room, they may stay in left lane but go straight ahead
- **Cycle lanes**: Don't park or drive in them during operational hours
- **Weather**: Cyclists are more affected by wind and rain - allow extra space

## 4. Motorcyclists
- **Blind spots**: Check carefully - motorbikes are small and hard to see
- **Weather**: More vulnerable to slippery surfaces and strong winds
- **Road surfaces**: Motorcyclists may swerve to avoid potholes or debris
- **Junctions**: Many accidents occur at junctions - double check before pulling out

## 5. Horse Riders
- **Slow down** early and be prepared to stop
- **Don't rev engine** or use horn - horses can be easily frightened
- **Pass wide and slow** - leave at least 2 metres space
- **Watch for signals** - riders may signal they want you to stop or slow down

## 6. Large Vehicles
- **Longer stopping distances** - don't pull out in front of them
- **Blind spots** - stay out of areas where they can't see you
- **Manoeuvring**: They need more space to turn - don't try to pass on the inside
- **Overtaking**: Only when safe and you can see clear road ahead

## 7. Emergency Vehicles
- **Don't panic** - check where the emergency vehicle is coming from
- **Pull over if safe** and necessary to let them pass
- **Don't break the law** - don't go through red lights or enter bus lanes illegally
- **At roundabouts**: Continue to exit then pull over if possible

## 8. Key Distances to Remember
- **Cyclists**: 1.5 metres minimum when overtaking
- **Horses**: 2 metres minimum when passing
- **Pedestrians**: Slow right down and be prepared to stop
