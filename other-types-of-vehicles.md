# Other Types of Vehicle - Driving Theory Notes

## 1. Buses
- **Bus lanes**: Don't drive in them during hours of operation (signs show times)
- **Pulling out**: Buses may pull out from stops - be prepared to slow down/stop
- **Priority**: Some buses have priority when pulling out - look for flashing indicators

## 2. Trams
- **Shared roads**: Look for rails and overhead wires
- **Give way**: Always give way to trams - they can't steer around you
- **Overtaking**: Never overtake a moving tram - only pass when it's at a stop
- **Stops**: Trams may stop at designated platforms - watch for passengers crossing
- **Parking**: Don't park where you would obstruct tram lines

## 3. Large Goods Vehicles (LGVs/HGVs)
- **Blind spots**: Large areas all around - if you can't see their mirrors, they can't see you
- **Stopping distance**: Much longer than cars - never cut in front sharply
- **Turning**: Need extra space - they may swing out before turning
- **Wind effect**: Can be blown sideways in strong winds - keep your distance

## 4. Agricultural Vehicles
- **Slow moving**: Often travel at 25mph or less
- **Wide loads**: May take up more than one lane
- **Mud on road**: Can make surfaces slippery - slow down
- **Overtaking**: Only when safe and legal - they may turn into fields unexpectedly

## 5. Tractors
- **Very slow moving** - often below 20mph
- **Farm entrances** - likely to turn suddenly into fields or farm tracks
- **Mud/debris** - can drop mud, straw, or crops on the road creating hazards
- **Wide equipment** - may be towing wide machinery that extends beyond the lane
- **Time of day** - most common in early morning and late afternoon in rural areas

## 6. Emergency Vehicles
- **Blue lights/sirens**: Try to allow them to pass safely
- **Don't panic**: Avoid sudden braking or pulling over dangerously
- **Motorways**: Move left if safe to do so
- **Box junctions**: Don't enter if you'd block the junction when stopping for emergency vehicle

## 7. Vehicles with Flashing Amber Beacons
- **Slow-moving vehicles**: Road maintenance, gritters, refuse collection
- **Be prepared**: They may stop frequently or travel slowly
- **Overtake**: Only when safe and legal to do so

## 8. Key Rules for All Large Vehicles
- **Don't tailgate (Follow them closely)** - you can't see the road ahead
- **Be patient** - they need more time to manoeuvre
- **Anticipate stops** - they may need to stop suddenly
- **Watch for signals** - indicators may come on well before they turn

## 9. Special Considerations
- **Long vehicles**: May take unusual lines at roundabouts and junctions
- **Height restrictions**: LGVs may need to avoid low bridges
- **Weight restrictions**: Some roads have weight limits for LGVs
