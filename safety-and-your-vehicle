- **Tread depth**: Legal minimum is 1.6mm across central ¾ of tyre and around entire circumference
- **Lights**: All lights must be clean and working (check headlights, brake lights, indicators)
- **Oil level**: Check regularly using dipstick

## 4. Environmental Considerations
- **Avoid wasting fuel**: Smooth acceleration, proper gear use, correct tyre pressure
- **Reduce pollution**: Regular servicing maintains efficient engine operation
