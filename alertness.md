# Alertness - Driving Theory Notes

## 1. Concentration & Attention
- **Always concentrate** - you need to concentrate 100% on your driving
- **Scan the road ahead** - don't just look immediately in front of your vehicle
- **Check mirrors regularly** - know what's happening around you at all times
- **Avoid distractions** - even a brief lapse in concentration can cause an accident

## 2. Major Distractions
- **Mobile phones** - illegal to hold or use while driving (emergency calls only when safely parked)
- **In-car systems** - sat nav, radio, climate control (set before driving)
- **Passengers** - especially children or animated conversations
- **Eating/drinking** - takes your attention away from the road
- **Smoking** - affects your concentration and can obscure vision

## 3. Anticipation & Observation
- **Look for clues** - watch other road users' behavior and vehicle positioning
- **Pedestrians** - especially children, elderly, disabled people
- **Cyclists & motorcyclists** - often harder to see, can be hidden in blind spots
- **Think ahead** - anticipate what might happen, not just what is happening

## 4. Fatigue & Tiredness
- **Warning signs**: 
  - Yawning frequently
  - Heavy eyelids/eyes closing
  - Missing road signs
  - Poor concentration
  - Variations in speed
- **Prevention**:
  - Get proper rest before long journeys
  - Take regular breaks (every 2 hours)
  - Stop in safe place if feeling tired
  - Don't drive after heavy meals or alcohol
  - Avoid driving when you'd normally be sleeping

## 5. Health & Medical Conditions
- **Don't drive** if you feel unwell or are on medication that causes drowsiness
- **Check medication labels** for driving warnings
- **Report relevant conditions** to DVLA (epilepsy, diabetes, heart conditions, etc.)
