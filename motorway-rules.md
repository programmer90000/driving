# Motorway Rules - Driving Theory Notes

## 1. Joining the Motorway
- **Use acceleration lane** to match motorway speed
- **Give way** to traffic already on the motorway
- **Don't force your way** into traffic - wait for a safe gap

## 2. Lane Discipline
- **Left lane** is the default driving lane
- **Middle/right lanes** are for overtaking only
- **Return to left lane** after overtaking
- **Don't hog the middle lane** - it's an offence

## 3. Lane Markings and Studs
- **White studs** Divides Lanes
- **Red studs** Left edge of the carriageway (Between lane and hard shoulder)
- **Amber studs** Right edge of the carriageway (Between the right lane and other side)
- **Green studs** mark slip road entrances and exits, lay-bys and emergency refuge areas

### To memorise the studs
- **White** - Divides the lanes
- **Red** - For vehicles needing to stop in an emergency (Between the hard shoulder and the lanes)
- **Amber** - Warning Sign (Separating the traffic flowing in both directions)
- **Green** - When entering and exiting the motorway

## 4. Overtaking
- **Overtake on the right** only
- **Never overtake on the left** unless traffic is moving in queues
- **Check mirrors and blind spots** before changing lanes
- **Use indicators** when changing lanes

## 5. Speed Limits
- **70 mph** for cars and motorcycles
- **60 mph** for cars towing trailers
- **Variable speed limits** shown on overhead signs are legally enforceable
- **Red X** above lane means lane closed - move out immediately

## 6. Smart Motorways
- **Hard shoulder** may be used as running lane when shown by speed limit sign
- **Emergency Refuge Areas (ERAs)** - use these if you break down, NOT hard shoulder
- **Red X** means lane closed - obey immediately
- **Variable speed limits** help manage traffic flow

## 7. Breakdowns
- **Try to reach left lane or hard shoulder**
- **On smart motorways**: reach ERA (Emergency Refuge Area) or left lane if possible
- **Use hazard lights** and sidelights in poor visibility
- **Exit vehicle** via left-side doors and wait behind barrier
- **Use emergency phone** - it tells control centre your exact location

## 8. Stopping & Parking
- **Never stop** on motorway except in emergencies
- **No parking** on hard shoulder unless in emergency
- **No U-turns** or reversing
- **No learner drivers** on motorways

## 9. Leaving the Motorway
- **Check route signs** in advance
- **Get into left lane** in good time
- **Use deceleration lane** to reduce speed
- **Check your speedometer** after leaving - it's easy to drive too fast on slower roads without realising

## 10. Following Distance
- **Use the two-second rule** in good conditions
- **Double to four seconds** in wet weather
- **Increase to twenty seconds** in icy conditions

## 11. Weather Conditions
- **Use headlights** in poor visibility
- **Reduce speed** in rain, fog, or high winds
- **Beware of spray** from large vehicles

## 12. Prohibited Vehicles
- **Learner drivers** not allowed
- **Certain slow vehicles** not permitted (e.g. under 50cc engine size - small engine motorcycles/mopeds)
- **Agricultural vehicles** generally not allowed
- **Pedestrians, cyclists, horses** prohibited

## 13. Emergency Vehicles
- **Move left** if safe to do so
- **Don't stop** in middle or right lanes
- **Don't enter hard shoulder** to let them pass
- **In queues**: leave space for them to pass between lanes
