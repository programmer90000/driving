# Vehicle Handling - Theory Test Notes

## 1. Braking

### Key Principles for the Test:
*   **Stopping Distance = Thinking Distance + Braking Distance**
    *   **Thinking Distance:** The distance travelled from when you see a hazard to when you press the brake. Affected by:
        *   Your speed (double the speed = double the distance).
        *   Your reaction time (affected by tiredness, alcohol, drugs, distractions).
    *   **Braking Distance:** The distance travelled from when you press the brake to when the vehicle stops. Affected by:
        *   Your speed (double the speed = **quadruple** the distance).
        *   The road surface (wet, icy, oily).
        *   The condition of your tyres (legally required tread depth).
        *   The effectiveness of your brakes.
*   **Two-Second Rule:** The minimum safe gap in good conditions. Pick a stationary point; when the car ahead passes it, say "only a fool breaks the two-second rule." You should not reach the point before you finish the phrase. Increase to **four seconds** in wet weather and even more in ice or snow.
*   **Brake Fade:** Caused by overheating the brakes through constant or harsh braking, especially on long descents. It reduces braking effectiveness.
    *   **Test Answer:** Use a lower gear for "engine braking" to avoid this.
*   **Skidding:** Caused by harsh braking, acceleration, or steering.
    *   **Test Answer (Modern Cars):** Remove the cause (e.g., ease off the brake/accelerator). DO NOT brake harshly or steer violently. The car's electronic stability systems will help.
    *   **Test Answer (Older Cars without ABS):** "Cadence Braking" - pump the brakes to prevent wheels from locking.

## 2. Steering

### Key Principles for the Test:
*   **The 'Pull-Push' (Feed-and-Slide) Technique:** This is the recommended method for the theory test. It ensures you always have full control of the steering wheel and is the safest, especially if a front tyre bursts.
    *   Avoid crossing your hands or "shuffling" the wheel one-handed.
*   **Steering while Braking:** Reduces your control. Brake *before* you steer into a bend or corner.
*   **Power Steering:** Makes steering easier, but you get less "feel" for the road. Be aware it can be heavier if the engine stalls.

## 3. Use of Gears

### Key Principles for the Test:
*   **Block Gear Changing:** The test expects you to know this. It means skipping gears (e.g., changing from 5th to 3rd, or 4th to 2nd) when slowing down. This improves control and reduces wear on the brakes and clutch.
*   **When to Change Gear:** Change gear to match the engine's workload and speed.
    *   **Going Uphill:** You may need a **lower** gear to maintain speed.
    *   **Going Downhill:** Select a **lower** gear to use **engine braking** and avoid relying solely on the brakes.
*   **Coasting:** **NEVER** coast (rolling in neutral or with the clutch down). It's dangerous because:
    *   You have less control.
    *   You cannot accelerate out of a dangerous situation.
    *   It reduces braking efficiency.
*   **Modern Cars:** It is often more fuel-efficient to slow down using the brakes in gear, rather than changing down through each gear, as modern engines cut fuel on overrun.

## 4. Use of the Clutch

### Key Principles for the Test:
*   **Biting Point:** The point where the engine just starts to move the car. You need to find it to move away smoothly.
*   **Don't "Ride" the Clutch:** Keeping your foot on the clutch pedal when not changing gear causes wear and damage.
*   **Use for Control:** Use the clutch and a low gear (e.g., first or second) for slow-speed manoeuvres like parking or moving in slow-moving traffic.

## 5. Acceleration

### Key Principles for the Test:
*   **Use Accelerator Smoothly:** Harsh acceleration can cause loss of control, particularly in wet or icy conditions (**aquaplaning** or wheel spin).
*   **Accelerating Safely:** The correct procedure is **Mirrors -> Signal -> Manoeuvre -> Position -> Speed -> Look (MSM/PSL)**. Your speed is adjusted after you have assessed the situation and are in the correct position.
*   **Fuel-Efficient Driving:** Accelerate smoothly and change up to a higher gear as soon as possible without making the engine labour.

## 6. Speed

### Key Principles for the Test:
*   **Always be able to stop** in the distance you can see to be clear.
*   The speed limit is a **maximum**, not a target. Adjust your speed for:
    *   **Road Conditions:** Weather, visibility, road surface.
    *   **Traffic Conditions:** Volume of traffic, pedestrians.
    *   **The Vehicle's Condition:** Load, tyre pressure.
*   **Excessive Speed:** Is a major factor in crash severity. The faster you go, the greater the impact force.

## 7. Use of the Horn & Headlights

### Key Principles for the Test:
*   **Horn:**
    *   **Use:** Only to warn other road users *of your presence*.
    *   **Do Not Use:** Aggressively, between 11:30 pm and 7:00 am in a built-up area, or when stationary (unless a moving vehicle poses a danger).
*   **Headlights:**
    *   **Must Use:** When visibility is seriously reduced (less than 100 metres). This is a common question.
    *   **Dipped Headlights:** Use at night, in poor daytime visibility, and in well-lit areas.
    *   **Full Beam:** Use only on unlit roads at night, but **dip them** for oncoming traffic or when following another vehicle to avoid dazzling the driver.
    *   **Hazard Warning Lights:** Use only when your vehicle is stationary and causing a temporary obstruction, or when driving on a motorway/unrestricted dual carriageway to warn drivers behind of a hazard ahead. **Do not use while moving** unless on the aforementioned high-speed roads to warn of a hazard ahead.

### Theory Test Tip:
Many questions are about **safety** and **environmental responsibility**. The safest, most fuel-efficient, and least polluting option is often the correct answer.
