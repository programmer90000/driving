# Basic Concepts & Definitions
---
*   When I pick up the clutch a little bit when starting the car, it is called the biting point
*   Stay a cm away from the kerb while driving
*   Before doing anything, I need to check the mirrors and blind spot

# Changing Gears
---
*   To change gears, push the clutch down quickly. Bring it up slowly
*   When going up a gear, go directly into that gear unless I am changing from gear 3 or 4
*   When I go down a gear, go into neutral first

# Hill Control

*   When going downhill, use the break to control the car
*   When going uphill, use the clutch to control the car

# Car Control Locations
---
*   Signalling up/down is left of the wheel
*   Wipers are right side of the wheel

# Signal Directions
---
*   Signalling up is right
*   Signalling down is left
