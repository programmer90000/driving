# How to enter the car

1. Push the seat forward or backwards until I am in a good position
2. Fasten the seatbelt
3. Make sure the gearstick is in neutral
5. Make sure the handbrake is up
4. Adjust the mirrors. I should be able to see almost all of the back window from the main mirror. I should be able to see the car handles and the road from the side mirrors
