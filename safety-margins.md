# Safety Margins

## Stopping Distances

### The Two-Second Rule
  * This is the **minimum** safe gap you should leave between you and the vehicle in front in good, dry conditions.
  * This is a rule for **dry conditions** and a **safe separation distance while moving**.

### Overall Stopping Distance
  This is the total distance your car travels from the moment you see a hazard to the moment your vehicle stops. It is made up of two parts:
  * **Thinking Distance:** The distance travelled from seeing the hazard to applying the brakes.
        * This is affected by your **reaction time**.
        * Average thinking distance is about **0.67 seconds**.
        * **Factors that increase thinking distance:** Tiredness, illness, alcohol, drugs, distractions.
    * **Braking Distance:** The distance travelled from applying the brakes to the vehicle stopping.
        * This is affected by the **vehicle and road conditions**.
        * **Factors that increase braking distance:** Worn tyres or brakes, wet/icy roads, a heavier vehicle, poor road surface.
    **Overall Stopping Distance = Thinking Distance + Braking Distance**

### Stopping Distance Table (for the test)
  Memorise these typical distances for a car in good condition on a dry road. The test will expect you to know these figures.
  | Speed | Thinking Distance | Braking Distance | **Total Stopping Distance** |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | 20 mph | 6 metres | 6 metres | **12 metres** (3 car lengths) |
  | 30 mph | 9 metres | 14 metres | **23 metres** (6 car lengths) |
  | 40 mph | 12 metres | 24 metres | **36 metres** (9 car lengths) |
  | 50 mph | 15 metres | 38 metres | **53 metres** (13 car lengths) |
  | 60 mph | 18 metres | 55 metres | **73 metres** (18 car lengths) |
  | 70 mph | 21 metres | 75 metres | **96 metres** (24 car lengths) |
  
  **Key point:** When you double your speed, your braking distance increases by about **four times**.

## Weather Conditions

### Wet Weather
  * It can take **twice as long** to stop in the wet compared to dry conditions.
    * **Aquaplaning (or hydroplaning):** This occurs when a layer of water builds up between your tyres and the road surface, causing you to lose steering and braking control.
        * **If you aquaplane:** Ease off the accelerator and slow down gradually. Do not brake or steer sharply.

### Icy or Snowy Weather
  * It can take **ten times as long** to stop in icy conditions compared to dry conditions.
    * Drive very slowly, avoid harsh actions, and use the highest gear possible to avoid wheel spin.
    * **Braking on ice:** Use gentle, cadence braking (push-release, push-release) to prevent skidding. If you have ABS, press the brake firmly; the system will pump for you.

### Windy Weather
  * Be especially careful when passing **high-sided vehicles** or when crossing **bridges** or **open stretches of road**.
    * Be prepared for sudden gusts of wind.
    * After overtaking a high-sided vehicle, a gust can pull you back towards it.

### Fog and Low Sun
  * **Use your dipped headlights** in fog. **Do not** use full beam, as the light will reflect off the fog and dazzle you.
    * **Use fog lights** only when visibility is seriously reduced (less than 100 metres). **You MUST switch them off when visibility improves.**
    * A dirty windscreen will make the glare from low sun much worse. Keep it clean.

## Vehicle Condition

### Tyres
  * **Legal minimum tread depth:** **1.6 millimetres** across the **central three-quarters** of the tyre, around the **entire circumference**.
    * **How to check:** Use a tread depth gauge or check the tread wear indicators built into the tyre.
    * **Effect of worn tyres:** Drastically increased braking distance, especially in the wet. Increased risk of punctures and blowouts.
    * **Tyre pressure:** Check regularly when tyres are cold. Incorrect pressure increases wear, reduces grip, and uses more fuel.

### Brakes
  * Test your brakes when you first set out, before you need to use them seriously.
    * **Brake fade:** Can be caused by overheating from continuous heavy braking (e.g., down a long hill). To prevent this, use a lower gear for **engine braking**.

### Other Safety Checks
  * **Lights, indicators, and reflectors:** Must be clean and working.
    * **Windscreen, windows, and mirrors:** Must be clean and clear.
    * **Washers and wipers:** Must be in good working order with plenty of screenwash.

## Skidding

### Causes of Skidding
  * Driver error is the most common cause.
    * **Specific causes:** Harsh acceleration, braking too hard, steering too sharply, or going too fast for the road conditions.

### How to Avoid Skidding
  * **Drive smoothly and progressively.**
    * Adjust your speed to suit the road and weather conditions.
    * Leave a larger safety margin (e.g., use the **four-second rule** in the wet).
    * Slow down in good time before a bend.

### How to Correct a Skid (Front-wheel drive cars)
  * **Ease off the accelerator.**
    * **Do not brake.**
    * **Steer gently into the skid.** For example, if the back of the car slides to the right, steer smoothly to the right.

## Separation Distances

### Increasing the Gap
  You should **at least double** the two-second rule in the following conditions:
    * In **wet weather** -> Use the **four-second rule**.
    * In **icy or snowy weather** -> Use an even larger gap (up to ten times the normal distance).
    * When **riding a motorcycle** (to protect yourself).
    * When driving a **large vehicle** (as it takes longer to stop).

### When Being Overtaken
  * If a vehicle is overtaking you, stay back and **do not increase your speed**. This helps to reduce the amount of time they are on the wrong side of the road.

## Key Things to Remember for the Test

  * **Stopping Distance = Thinking Distance + Braking Distance.**
    * Memorise the **23 metres at 30 mph** and **96 metres at 70 mph** stopping distances.
    * The **two-second rule** is for dry conditions. Double it to **four seconds** in the wet.
    * **Wet weather = 2x stopping distance. Icy weather = 10x stopping distance.**
    * **Minimum tyre tread depth is 1.6mm.**
    * To avoid a skid, **ease off the accelerator** and **do not brake.**
    * **Use dipped headlights in fog.** Use fog lights only when visibility is **less than 100 metres.**
