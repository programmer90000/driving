# First Aid

## DR ABC
  * **D** - **Danger**
        * **ALWAYS YOUR FIRST ACTION.**
        * Ensure the area is safe for you and others. Check for ongoing traffic, fire, spilled fuel, broken glass, etc.
        * **Do not** become a casualty yourself.

    * **R** - **Response**
        * Check if the casualty is conscious or unconscious.
        * Gently shake their shoulders and ask loudly, "Are you alright?"
        * **If they respond:** They are conscious. Leave them in the position you found them (if safe), and assess their injuries.
        * **If they do not respond:** They are unconscious. Shout for help and proceed to A.

    * **A** - **Airway**
        * Open the airway. An unconscious person's tongue can block their airway.
        * Tilt their head back gently and lift the chin. This moves the tongue away from the back of the throat.

    * **B** - **Breathing**
        * Check for normal breathing for no more than 10 seconds.
        * **Look, Listen, and Feel.** Look for chest movement, listen for breath sounds, and feel for air on your cheek.
        * **If they are breathing normally:** Place them in the **Recovery Position**. This keeps the airway open. Then call 999 for an ambulance.
        * **If they are not breathing, or not breathing normally (e.g., occasional gasps):** Proceed to C.

    * **C** - **Circulation (CPR)**
        * Start Chest Compressions immediately.
        * **Call 999 first, or get someone else to call while you start CPR.**
        * **How to do chest compressions:**
            * Kneel by the side of the casualty.
            * Place the heel of one hand on the centre of their chest (breastbone).
            * Place your other hand on top and interlock your fingers.
            * Keep your arms straight and press down hard and fast—about 5-6 cm deep.
            * Compress at a rate of 100-120 per minute.
            * Do not stop until a professional takes over, you become exhausted, or the casualty shows signs of life.

## Bleeding and Wounds

### Dealing with Severe Bleeding
  * **Your aim is to stop or control the bleeding.**
    * **Do not** try to remove any objects embedded in the wound.
    * **Steps:**
        1. Apply **direct pressure** over the wound with your gloved hand, using a clean pad or dressing if available.
        2. If an object is embedded, **apply pressure on either side of the object**, not directly on top of it.
        3. Raise and support the injured limb above the level of the heart (if no broken bones are suspected).
        4. Lay the casualty down to treat for shock.
        5. Secure the dressing with a bandage, but not so tight that it restricts circulation.
        6. If blood soaks through, **do not remove the first dressing**. Apply a second one on top.

### Treatment for Shock
  Shock is a life-threatening condition where vital organs don't get enough oxygenated blood.

  * **Causes:** Severe bleeding, burns, heart attack, etc.
    * **Signs/Symptoms:** Pale, cold, clammy skin; rapid, weak pulse; fast, shallow breathing; feeling weak, dizzy, or nauseous; thirst.
    * **Treatment:**
        1. Treat the cause (e.g., severe bleeding).
        2. Lay the casualty down. Raise and support their legs (unless you suspect a broken leg).
        3. Keep them warm with a coat or blanket, but **do not** give them any source of direct heat.
        4. Loosen tight clothing around the neck, chest, and waist.
        5. **Do not** give them anything to eat or drink.
        6. Reassure them and call 999.

## Burns and Broken Bones

### Dealing with Burns
  * **Cool the burn** as quickly as possible.
    * **Steps:**
        1. Flood the burn with cool, running water for **at least 20 minutes**.
        2. Remove any jewellery or clothing near the burn **unless it is stuck to the skin**.
        3. After cooling, cover the burn with a sterile, non-fluffy dressing or cling film to prevent infection.
        4. **Do NOT:**
            * Use adhesive dressings.
            * Apply creams, lotions, or fats (e.g., butter).
            * Burst any blisters.
            * Remove anything stuck to the burn.

### Dealing with a Broken Bone
  * **Your aim is to prevent further movement and support the injury.**
    * **Do not** move the casualty unless they are in immediate danger.
    * **Signs/Symptoms:** Pain, inability to move the limb, swelling, bruising, deformity, or an unnatural angle.
    * **Treatment:**
        1. Tell the casualty to keep still.
        2. Steady and support the injured part with your hands, or use padding/bandages to hold it in place.
        3. For a broken leg, you can immobilise it by tying it to the uninjured leg.
        4. Treat for shock if necessary.

## Specific Conditions

### Dealing with a Seizure (Fit)
  * **Your aim is to protect the casualty from injury.**
    * **Do NOT** put anything in their mouth or try to restrain them.
    * **Steps:**
        1. **Protect their head.** Place padding (like a coat) under it.
        2. Clear space around them to prevent them from hitting objects.
        3. After the convulsions stop, open their airway and check for breathing. Place them in the **Recovery Position** if they are unconscious but breathing.
        4. Call 999/112.

### Dealing with a Heart Attack
  * **Signs/Symptoms:** Persistent, vice-like chest pain which may spread to arms, neck, or back; breathlessness; dizziness; pale, clammy skin; nausea.
    * **Steps:**
        1. Help the casualty into a comfortable position. A half-sitting position with knees bent is often best.
        2. Call 999/112 immediately.
        3. Loosen tight clothing around the neck and chest.
        4. Reassure them. If they have their own medication (like a spray), help them use it.
        5. Be prepared to perform CPR if they become unconscious and stop breathing.

## The Recovery Position
  This is for an unconscious casualty who is breathing normally. It keeps the airway clear and open.

  1. Kneel beside them. Remove their glasses and any bulky items from their pockets.
    2. Place the arm nearest to you at a right angle to their body, elbow bent, palm facing up.
    3. Bring the far arm across their chest and hold the back of their hand against their near cheek.
    4. With your other hand, grasp the far leg just above the knee and pull it up, keeping the foot flat on the ground.
    5. Keeping their hand pressed against their cheek, pull on the far leg to roll the casualty towards you and onto their side.
    6. Adjust the top leg so the hip and knee are bent at right angles.
    7. Tilt the head back to ensure the airway remains open.
    8. Call 999 and monitor their breathing until help arrives.

## In a Traffic Incident

  * Your own safety is the **number one priority**.
    * **Stop your car in a safe place**, turn off the engine, and switch on your hazard warning lights.
    * Get yourself and any casualties to a safe place away from traffic.
    * **Call 999** for emergency services. Be ready to tell them your exact location, the number of vehicles involved, and the number and condition of casualties.
    * **Do not** remove a motorcyclist's helmet unless it is essential to maintain their airway.

## Key Things to Remember for the Test

  * **Danger is ALWAYS your first check.**
    * **DR ABC** is the golden rule for the primary survey.
    * The **Recovery Position** is for an unconscious casualty who is **breathing**.
    * **CPR** is for an unconscious casualty who is **not breathing**.
    * For severe bleeding: **Direct Pressure** and **Raise the limb**.
    * For burns: **Cool with running water for 20 minutes**.
    * For a suspected broken bone: **Support it, do not move it**.
    * **Always call 999/112** for a serious incident. If unsure, it's better to call.
