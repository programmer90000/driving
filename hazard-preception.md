Clicking means checking the mirrors

There are 14 videos in the hazard preception test. 13 videos have one hazard. 1 video has 2 hazards. Each hazard can score a maxiumm of 5 points. You need to get a score of 44/75 to pass

To get a score, I need to click inside the countdown window. If I click too early, it will score 0 points

To stop this happening, use the 2-click method.

The 2-click method:
1. As soon as I see the problem, click once
2. Count 2 seconds
3. Click again

I need to click when anything will cause me to:
- Slow down
- Change direction
