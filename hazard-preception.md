Clicking means checking the mirrors

There are 14 videos in the hazard preception test. 13 videos have one hazard. 1 video has 2 hazards. Each hazard can score a maxiumm of 5 points. You need to get a score of 44/75 to pass

To get a score, I need to click inside the countdown window. If I click too early, it will score 0 points

To stop this happening, use the 2-click method.

The 2-click method:
1. As soon as I see the problem, click once
2. Count 2 seconds
3. Click again

I need to click when anything will cause me to:
- Slow down
- Change direction































# Stages of a hazard

## Potential Hazard

This is the earliest sign that a situation might develop into a hazard. You are observing and gathering information.

· What it is: Something that is not yet a direct threat but has the potential to become one.
· Your Action: Do **NOT** click at this stage. Simply register the information and prepare for what might happen next.
· Examples:
  · You see a ball roll into the road from behind a parked car.
  · You see a pedestrian standing on the pavement looking at their phone, not the road.
  · You see a car waiting to pull out from a side road ahead.
  · You see a cyclist ahead in the distance.

## Developing Hazard

This is the critical stage where the potential hazard starts to become a real one. It's the point where you, as a driver, would need to begin to take action (e.g., lift off the accelerator, cover the brake, or check your mirrors).

· What it is: The situation has changed, and the risk is now immediate and requires a response from you.
· Your Action: This is when you should click. You typically get points for clicking during this phase, with the highest score for clicking as soon as it starts to develop.
· Examples:
  · The child runs out from behind the parked car chasing the ball.
  · The pedestrian on their phone suddenly steps into the road without looking.
  · The car in the side road begins to pull out in front of you.
  · The cyclist ahead starts to swerve to avoid a pothole.

## Actual Hazard

This is the final stage where the hazard is fully realized, and you must take definitive action to avoid a collision (e.g., brake firmly or steer away).

· What it is: The situation now presents a clear and immediate danger.
· Your Action: If you click for the first time at this stage, it's often too late to score high marks, or you may score zero. The "developing" phase has passed.
· Examples:
  · The child is now directly in your path.
  · The pedestrian is walking across your lane.
  · The car has fully committed to pulling out, blocking your way.
  · The cyclist has moved directly into your path.

# A Practical Example

Scenario: Approaching a parked van on a residential street.

## Potential Hazard

You see the parked van on your side of the road. You also notice shadows of people moving on the pavement behind it.
   · Your Thought: "There might be someone behind that van."
   · Action: No click. You simply observe and prepare by easing off the accelerator slightly.

## Developing Hazard - CLICK NOW

A person suddenly steps out from in front of the van into the road, trying to cross.
   · Your Thought: "They are stepping into my path! I need to brake."
   · Action: Click immediately. This is the moment the situation changes from potential to actual risk requiring your action.

## Actual Hazard
The person is now fully in your lane, and you are braking firmly to avoid them.
   · Your Thought: "Emergency stop!"
   · Action: If you are only clicking now, it's too late to score high points.

# The Scoring System Explained

The test uses a sliding scale of 0 to 5 points per hazard clip:

· 5 points: You click very early in the "Developing Hazard" stage (Stage 2).
· 3-4 points: You click a little later in the developing stage but still in good time.
· 1-2 points: You click very late in the developing stage or at the very start of the actual hazard.
· 0 points: You click too late (in Stage 3), or you click during the potential hazard stage (Stage 1) or randomly/multiple times in quick succession (which can flag you as cheating).

## Key Tips for Success

· Click for the Change: Don't click for every car or pedestrian you see. Click when their status changes in a way that affects you (e.g., they start to move into your path).
