# Rules of the Road - Driving Theory Notes

## 1. Speed Limits
- **Built-up areas**: 30 mph (unless signs show otherwise)
- **Single carriageways**: 60 mph (a road with one lane in each direction, no physical central barrier)
- **Dual carriageways**: 70 mph (a road with a central reservation/barrier separating traffic flowing in opposite directions)
- **Motorways**: 70 mph

## 2. Road Junctions
- **Unmarked junctions**: No one has priority - proceed with caution
- **Turning right**: Give way to oncoming traffic
- **Emerging**: Give way to traffic on major road
- **T-junctions**: Traffic on major road has priority

## 3. Roundabouts
- **Approach**: Slow down and choose correct lane
- **Give way** to traffic from your right already on roundabout
- **First exit (left)**: Signal left on approach, stay in left lane
- **Straight ahead**: No signal on approach, use left or middle lane, signal left after passing exit before yours
- **Right/last exit**: Signal right on approach, use right lane, signal left after passing exit before yours

## 4. Traffic Lights
- **Red**: Stop at stop line
- **Red and Amber**: Prepare to go but don't move off
- **Green**: Go if way is clear
- **Amber**: Stop unless you've already crossed stop line

## 5. Level Crossings
- **Stop** when red lights flash
- **Never queue** across the crossing
- **If barriers stay down**, wait - don't drive around them
- **If you break down** on crossing, get everyone out immediately

## 6. Pedestrian Crossings
- **Zebra crossings**: Must stop if someone is waiting to cross
- **Pelican crossings**: Traffic light controlled, has flashing amber phase after red
- **Puffin crossings**: Traffic light controlled, no flashing amber phase
- **Toucan crossings**: Both cyclists and pedestrians can cross together

## 7. Parking Rules
- **Don't park** where you would obstruct emergency vehicles
- **Don't park** within 10 metres of a junction
- **Don't park** on pedestrian crossings or zig-zag lines
- **Don't park** opposite a traffic island

## 8. One-way Streets
- **Travel only** in direction indicated by signs
- **Park on left or right** unless signs or road markings say otherwise
- **May pass** on either side in a one-way street

## 9. Bus and Cycle Lanes
- **Blue rectangular signs** show times of operation
- **White road markings** show lane boundaries
- **Don't drive** in them during operational hours
- **Never park** in bus or cycle lanes

## 10. Road Markings
- **Double white lines**: 
  - Solid line nearest you = do not cross/overtake
  - Broken line nearest you = may cross if safe
- **Stop line** (thick solid line): Must stop completely
- **Give way line** (broken triangles): Give way to traffic on major road
- **Box junctions** (yellow criss-cross): Don't enter unless your exit is clear
- **Zig-zag lines**: No stopping, no overtaking

## 11. Traffic Officers
- **Must obey** signals from traffic officers
- **Have powers** to stop vehicles
- **Wear uniform** with yellow and black jackets
