# Hazard Awareness - Theory Test Notes

## 1. Understanding Hazards

### Key Principles for the Test:
*   **A Hazard:** Anything that would cause you to change speed, direction, or stop.
*   **Potential Hazard:** Something that could become dangerous but currently requires no action (e.g., a parked car in the distance).
*   **Developing Hazard:** A potential hazard that starts to change and NOW requires you to take action (e.g., the parked car's brake lights come on, or a door opens).
*   **The Goal:** To identify developing hazards EARLY so you can react safely and smoothly, not suddenly.

## 2. The Hazard Awareness Process (IPSGA)

### Key Principles for the Test:
*   **Information (I):** Constant observation is key.
    *   **Scanning:** Look far ahead, to the middle, and near. Don't just stare at the car in front.
    *   **Mirrors:** Check them frequently (every 5-8 seconds) to know what's around you.
    *   **Looking for Clues:** Watch for brake lights, indicators, pedestrians looking towards the road, and the wheels of parked cars (they may start to turn).
*   **Position (P):** Adjust your position on the road to improve your view and safety.
    *   Move away from potential dangers (e.g., give more space to a cyclist).
    *   Improve your line of sight approaching a blind bend or crest of a hill.
*   **Speed (S):** This is your primary tool for dealing with hazards.
    *   Slow down early and progressively. This gives you more time to think and react.
    *   Cover the brake pedal to reduce reaction time.
*   **Gear (G):** Select the correct gear for your new, lower speed.
    *   This gives you control and the ability to accelerate if needed to avoid a danger.
*   **Acceleration (A):** Once the hazard has passed and it is safe, accelerate smoothly back to your normal speed.

## 3. The Two-Second Rule & Safety Margins

### Key Principles for the Test:
*   **The Two-Second Rule:** The minimum safe following distance in good, dry conditions.
    *   **How to use it:** Pick a fixed point. When the car ahead passes it, say "only a fool breaks the two-second rule." You should not reach the point before you finish the phrase.
*   **Increasing the Gap:** You must increase your following distance in poor conditions.
    *   **Wet Weather:** Double it to at least **four seconds**.
    *   **Icy or Snowy Weather:** Increase it to **20 seconds**
*   **Stopping Distance:** Remember, this is **Thinking Distance + Braking Distance**.
    *   Your speed dramatically affects both. Double the speed means double the thinking distance, but the braking distance is quadrupled.

## 4. Types of Hazards & Specific Responses

### Key Principles for the Test:
*   **Junctions & Roundabouts:**
    *   **Response:** Slow down on approach. Be prepared to stop. Look for vehicles emerging, pedestrians crossing, and cyclists.
*   **Pedestrians (Especially Vulnerable):**
    *   **Children:** Be prepared for them to run into the road without looking. Slow down near parks, and ice cream vans.
    *   **Elderly:** They may not see or hear you and could be slow to cross.
    *   **Response:** Slow down and be prepared to stop. Give them plenty of room.
*   **Cyclists & Motorcyclists:**
    *   **Why they are a hazard:** They can be hard to see (in blind spots) and are vulnerable. They may swerve to avoid drains or potholes.
    *   **Response:** When passing, give them as much space as you would a car. Check your mirrors and blind spots carefully before turning.
*   **Large Vehicles (Lorries, Buses):**
    *   **Why they are a hazard:** They have large blind spots, need more space to turn (especially at roundabouts and junctions), and can create wind buffeting.
    *   **Response:** Stay out of their blind spots. Do not squeeze between a large vehicle and the kerb. Be patient and give them extra space.
*   **Adverse Weather (Rain, Fog, Ice):**
    *   **Response:** The universal answer is to **slow down** and **increase your following distance**. In fog, use your dipped headlights (front and rear fog lights only if visibility is below 100m).

## 5. Using the MSM Routine

### Key Principles for the Test:
*   **Mirrors -> Signal -> Manoeuvre (MSM)** is the correct sequence for ANY change in speed or direction.
*   **Mirrors:** Check the relevant mirrors to see how your action will affect traffic behind and to the side.
*   **Signal:** Inform others of your intention in good time.
*   **Manoeuvre:** The final action (changing speed, changing direction, moving off).

## 6. Anticipation & Planning

### Key Principles for the Test:
*   **Ask "What If...?":** Constantly scan the road and predict what other road users might do.
    *   *"What if that pedestrian steps out?"*
    *   *"What if that car pulls out from the side road?"*
*   **Lifesaver Glance:** A final, quick look over your shoulder into the blind spot before you change direction. This is essential for the practical test and a key safety habit.
*   **Drive Defensively:** Assume other road users might make a mistake and have a plan to deal with it. Your goal is to protect yourself and others from danger.
